Forth source code for a commercial Apple II Christmas card program

This is Apple II source code, in the Forth language, for a Christmas card program created by Prentice Associates, Inc. There are actually two versions here: for 1986 and 1987, recovered from Lloyd Prentice's original source code disks. The source code is released under the MIT License with Mr. Prentice's permission.

Not much more is known about this project. I haven't been able to find any reference to it, such as the title of the released product. Presumably it was released in two versions in 1986 and 1987.
